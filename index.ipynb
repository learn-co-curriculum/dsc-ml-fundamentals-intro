In this section you'll learn how to apply machine learning techniques using the familiar linear regression algorithm."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Statistical Learning Theory\n", "\n", "Statistical learning goes beyond the statistical modeling we have covered already. We will continue to build models that model the relationships between independent and dependent variables, but the emphasis will shift from ***inference*** to ***prediction***. In the predictive context we also need to consider model ***generalization*** and not just how well the model is fit to the training data."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["### Model Validation\n", "\n", "In order to assess how well a predictive model will generalize to unseen data, we need model ***validation*** techniques.

    "Statistical learning goes beyond the statistical modeling we have covered already. We will continue to build models that model the relationships between independent and dependent variables, but the emphasis will shift from ***inference*** to ***prediction***. In the predictive context we also need to consider model ***generalization*** and not just how well the model is fit to the training data."

    "\n",
    "Predictive modeling often involves striking the right balance between ***bias*** and ***variance***, also referred to as the balance between ***underfitting*** and ***overfitting***. Especially as you learn models beyond linear regression, you'll be able to tune the model performance to strike the right balance."

In this section we'll go over the theoretical concerns as well as the practical approaches to tackling them."
